odoo_l10n_cn_en-zh
===============

adds English terms to Odoo 8.0 Chinese Chart of accounts (l10n_cn)
this results into a bi-lingual (en-zh) Chinese Chart ot Accounts

these translations are google translation, so they are not beautifull but hopefully understandable

so far (2014-12-30) only acount_chart_small_business_template.xml is translated. The "big one" ist still pending

original repo is htttp://github.com/OCA/OCB [8.0]
